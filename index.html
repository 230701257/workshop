                        I’m working on a learning app for people with dyslexia, focusing on features like text-to-speech, speech-to-text, gamified learning, font customization, and phonetic assistance. I’m also creating an API for dyslexic learning that can integrate with platforms like Byju’s.
                        
                        Right now, I’m building a custom CNN model from scratch to detect deepfake images, using the Deepfake Detection Images dataset from Kaggle.
